# autopoiesis-simulation
This code is a Python-based simulation of **autopoiesis**, inspired by the work of **Humberto Maturana** and **Francisco Varela**. It aims to build a model self-organizing cellular automata in a liquid-like environment, where particles (substrates, catalysts, and links) interact dynamically to form and maintain structures.
