# Autopoiesis Simulation: Cellular Automata in Liquid Environment

This project is a Python-based simulation of **autopoiesis**, inspired by the work of **Humberto Maturana** and **Francisco Varela**. It aims to build a model of self-organizing cellular automata in a liquid-like environment, where particles (substrates, catalysts, and links) interact dynamically to form and maintain structures. The simulation is built using **Pygame** for visualization and **Pymunk** for physics-based interactions.

## Introduction

Autopoiesis refers to the self-maintaining and self-producing nature of living systems. This simulation explores the concept by modeling particles in a liquid environment that interact to form bonds, catalyze reactions, and maintain their structure over time. The simulation is a simplified representation of the principles outlined in Maturana and Varela's work, providing a visual and interactive way to understand autopoietic systems.

## Features

- **Dynamic Particle Interactions**: Substrates, catalysts, and links interact based on physical and chemical rules.
- **Brownian Motion**: Particles move randomly, simulating a liquid environment.
- **Self-Organization**: Particles form bonds and structures dynamically.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Built with Pygame for real-time rendering of the simulation.
- **Physics-Based Interactions**: Uses Pymunk for realistic physics simulations.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks the number of substrates, links, and bonds in real-time.
